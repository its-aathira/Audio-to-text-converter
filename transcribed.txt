You will hear a telephone conversation between a customer and an agent at a company which ships large boxes overseas. Good morning, Packham shipping agents. Can I help you? Oh yes, I'm ringing to make inquiries about sending a large box, a container back home to Kenya from the UK. Yes of course. Would you like me to try and find some quotations for you? Yes, that'd be great. Thank you. Well, first of all, I need a few details from you. Fine. Can I take your name? It's Jacob M. Carey. Can you spell your surname please? Yes, it's M-K-E-R-E. Is that M for mother? Yes. Thank you. And you say that you will be sending the box to Kenya. That's right. And where would you like the box picked up from? From college, if possible. Yes of course. I'll take down the address now. It's Westall College. Is that W-E-S-T-A-D-L? Yes, college. Westall College. And where's that? It's downlands road in Bristol. Oh yes, I know it. And the postcode? It's BS-8-9-P-U. Right. And I need to know the size. Yes, I've measured it carefully and it's 1.5 meters long. Right. 0.75 meters wide. Okay. And it's 0.5 meters high or deep. Great. So I'll calculate the volume in a moment and get some quotes for that. But first, can you tell me very generally what will be in the box? Yes, there's mostly clothes. Okay. And there's some books. Okay, good. Anything else? Yes, there's also some toys. Okay. And what is the total value, do you think, of the contents? Well, the main costs are the clothes and the books. They'll be about 1,500 pounds. But then the toys are about another 200. So I'd put down 1,700 pounds.
